# Code of Conduct

We shouldn't need it, but DC441905 operates the below code of conduct. By attending meets or joining the Discord servers you agree to abide by the below.

DC441905 provides a forum for open discussion between participants dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, political affiliation, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. This code of conduct applies to everyone participating at DC441905, both attendees and organisers. See something, say something. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the DC441905 organisers. Anyone asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion and referral to the relevant authorities. The views of the speakers and participants of this platform do not reflect the views of the DC441905 organisers.

We want DC441905 to be a safe and productive environment for everyone.
