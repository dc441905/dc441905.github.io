# Sponsors

DEF CON Groups must be free to attend — and DC441905 is no exception. But building a strong, welcoming hacker community takes more than just showing up.

We’re grateful to our sponsors for helping us make it all happen — from venues and snacks to CTF gear and speaker support. Their contributions help keep our events running smoothly and our community growing.

## Current Sponsors

We’re proud to be supported by:

### Arch Rivals

[Arch Rivals](https://g.page/Archpub) is a great little micro pub and brewery based in a railway arch in Worcester. We are very grateful they host us each month for our events.

### IASME

[IASME](https://iasme.co.uk/) is one of the UK's leading cyber security certification bodies, probably best known for Cyber Essentials, working to make cyber security accessible and achievable for all. We are grateful for their support in helping us pay for some of our online services.

## Support us

If you or your company are interested in sponsoring DC441905, we’d love to talk. Whether it’s financial backing, gear, cloud credits, pizza, or stickers — every bit helps. Get in touch with us online, or come along to any of the events and say hi.
