# Code of Conduct 

## Purpose

DC441905 operates a code of conduct as we are committed to making an inclusive and welcoming community for everyone. The purpose of this code of conduct is to ensure that every participant knows what behaviour is expected of them, and what they can expect from others, at both events and in any online channels.

## TL;DR

Respect each other. Intolerance is not tolerated. If you see something, say something.

## Code of Conduct

DC441905 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all participants. This includes event attendees, speakers, sponsors and organisors at both physical events and in our online channels. 

We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, or discriminatory behaviour of any form. Specifically do not make offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, political affiliation, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, or other prejudiced behaviour.

Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented physical contact, threatening behaviour, and unwanted sexual attention is harassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.

Sexualised language and imagery is not appropriate in public, or in sessions which do not deal directly with such topics.

People may not want to be filmed or photographed. You must have consent from anyone who is identifiable in a photo or video.

Aggression and elitism are not welcome â€” do not belittle people for their knowledge or experience. Allow others to express themselves and understand that all views are important even if they are not the same as your own.

Respect each other, the venue and its staff. Also respect the speaker by not talking amongst yourselves during presentations. Asking questions is encouraged, but respect the speakers method of handling questions during their presentation. Heckling and deliberate disruption will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop any harassing behaviour is expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a DC441905 organiser as soon as possible.  Anyone can report harassment. 

## Our response

If you have any issues with the behaviour of anyone at events on in online channels, please report it to one of the DC441905 organisers either in person or via a private messasge via our online channels. We commit that we will take each complaint seriously. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion and referral to the relevant authorities.
